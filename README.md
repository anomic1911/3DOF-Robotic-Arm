# 3 DOF Robotic Arm


We have used four bar mechanism to implement forward and backward motion and upward and downward motion using only two actuators.

## List of Components:
 Stepper and Servo motors, X-Channels, Acrylic Sheet, Nuts-Bolts, Arduino Mega ADK, PS3
controller
    
1) Design Finalization : Used four bar mechanism to actuate the shoulders efficiently
2) CAD Model : Designed the CAD model in Autodesk Inventor and Fusion 360
3) Simulation : Created an animation of the robot to test the design
4) Manufacturing (Mechanically) : Laser cut and 3D printed the parts
5) Electrical circuiting : Used stepper motor to rotate the turntable and servo motor to
actuate the legs and gripper of the arm
6) PS3 control : Controlled the robotic arm with a PS3 controller via an USB cable
7) Mechanical Model : Good working condition
8) Testing : All three servo motors are working individually
